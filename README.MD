# NoJira, No Bullshit, Just Problem Solving

## Development Environment

This project utilizes a monorepo structure, housing both the application server and the web application within the same repository. To get the development environment running, you'll need to start both components.

You have the option to run the App Server and Web App either concurrently or independently, depending on your development needs.

**To run both concurrently:**

From the root directory of the project, execute the following command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This command will initiate both the application server and the web application in parallel, streamlining your development workflow.

---

**To run them separately:**

### App Server (NestJS)

To start only the application server, navigate to its specific directory.
